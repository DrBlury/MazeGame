Hello and thank you for checking out this README file.


This is a little maze "game" which allows you to read custom <name>.maze files.
The .maze files should be written like the example below:

5
5
#####
#...#
#.@.#
#...#
#...#
#####

The first line containing "5" tells the program how many columns (5) the maze has.
The second line containing "6" tells the program how many rows (6) the maze has.
Anything other than a number in these two lines will throw an error.
This will determine the dimensions of your maze. Make sure to double check!

The maze contains three symbols ("#", "." and "@")
The "#" marks walls while the "." marks items to grab.
Lastly the "@" tells the program where your player should be.
Any other symbol will throw an error if you try to load the maze file.

The arrow keys are used for movement while you can also press space to move the player towards the next item.

Keep space pressed to auto-complete the maze! (Press the AUTO Button in the launcher first to enable this)

Note: 
You can always resize the window to your liking. 
The tiles will automatically resize to fit your window size.
